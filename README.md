## How UberEats Clone App Works?

* **Browsing Menu:**

Users search through a list of restaurants available in their local region. They can check each restaurant's menu, costs, ratings, reviews, and other relevant information.

Once a user has chosen a restaurant and products from the menu, they add these to their carts and move to the checkout. They can also make unique requests or preferences for their order.
* **Payment Processing:**

Users select a payment option and finish the transaction within the app. According to the app's settings, payment options may include credit/debit cards, online wallets, or cash on delivery.
* **Order Confirmation:**

* **Restaurant Notification:**

The restaurant receives order information via the app's backend infrastructure. In addition to confirming the order, they prepare the meal.

* **Real-time Tracking:**

Through the app, customers may monitor the progress of their orders in real-time. They get progress updates on order preparation, pickup, and delivery.
